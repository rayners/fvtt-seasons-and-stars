# Seasons & Stars Development Roadmap

> **A calendar and timekeeping solution for Foundry VTT v13+**

This roadmap outlines planned features and development priorities for Seasons & Stars. As an alpha project, timelines are estimates based on community feedback and development capacity.

## üéØ Project Vision

Seasons & Stars aims to provide a **reliable and extensible** calendar solution for Foundry VTT v13+ with:

- Clean, intuitive user interface built for Foundry v13+
- Comprehensive Simple Calendar compatibility for existing modules
- Rich calendar format supporting diverse fantasy settings
- Performance-optimized architecture for large campaigns

## üìã Current Status: v0.2.7 Alpha Release

**What's Working Now:**

- ‚úÖ **Core Calendar System**: Date calculations, multiple calendars, Foundry time integration
- ‚úÖ **Foundry v13+ UI**: Calendar widget, mini widget, grid view, calendar selection
- ‚úÖ **15 Built-in Calendars**: Gregorian, D&D settings, PF2e Golarion, Critical Role, Warhammer, and more
- ‚úÖ **Simple Calendar Compatibility**: API compatibility via separate bridge module
- ‚úÖ **SmallTime Integration**: Auto-positioning and visual consistency
- ‚úÖ **Notes System**: Backend API complete with full creation UI (categories, tags, recurring events)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes Editing**: Limited to basic Foundry journal interface - calendar metadata cannot be modified after creation
- üß™ **Error Reporting**: Optional Errors and Echoes integration (when module available)
- üß™ **Memory Integration**: Optional Memory Mage integration (pre-release development module)

**Testing Status:**

- üß™ **Alpha Quality**: Core calendar features tested and functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes System**: Creation UI functional, but editing requires calendar-aware interface for metadata management
- üìä **Test Coverage**: 72 automated tests passing (10.66% code coverage - primarily calendar engine and basic widget functionality)
- üîç **Seeking Feedback**: User testing and bug reports welcome, especially for notes system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**: See [Known Issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for current limitations

## üöÄ Planned Development

## üîÑ **Ongoing Foundation Work** (Cross-Release Priorities)

These high-priority initiatives span multiple releases and provide foundational capabilities for the entire ecosystem:

### **üîó Simple Calendar Feature Parity** ([#52](https://github.com/rayners/fvtt-seasons-and-stars/issues/52)) - **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Status**: Ongoing across multiple releases  
**Goal**: Complete API and feature compatibility with Simple Calendar for seamless migration

**Phase 1 (v0.5.0-v0.6.0)**: Core API compatibility, basic migration tools  
**Phase 2 (v0.7.0-v0.8.0)**: Advanced features, data migration, comprehensive testing  
**Phase 3 (v1.0.0)**: Full parity validation, performance optimization, production readiness

_This foundational work enables the entire Simple Calendar migration strategy and receives high priority across all releases. While final completion targets v1.0.0, incremental compatibility improvements happen in every release._
