# Seasons & Stars Development Roadmap

> **A calendar and timekeeping solution for Foundry VTT v13+**

This roadmap outlines planned features and development priorities for Seasons & Stars. As an alpha project, timelines are estimates based on community feedback and development capacity.

## üéØ Project Vision

Seasons & Stars aims to provide a **reliable and extensible** calendar solution for Foundry VTT v13+ with:

- Clean, intuitive user interface built for Foundry v13+
- Comprehensive Simple Calendar compatibility for existing modules
- Rich calendar format supporting diverse fantasy settings
- Performance-optimized architecture for large campaigns

## üìã Current Status: v0.2.3 Alpha Release

**What's Working Now:**

- ‚úÖ **Core Calendar System**: Date calculations, multiple calendars, Foundry time integration
- ‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Calendar widget, mini widget, grid view, calendar selection
- ‚úÖ **15 Built-in Calendars**: Gregorian, D&D settings, PF2e Golarion, Critical Role, Warhammer, and more
- ‚úÖ **Simple Calendar Compatibility**: API compatibility via separate bridge module
- ‚úÖ **SmallTime Integration**: Auto-positioning and visual consistency
- ‚úÖ **Notes System**: Backend API complete with full creation UI (categories, tags, recurring events)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes Editing**: Limited to basic Foundry journal interface - calendar metadata cannot be modified after creation
- üß™ **Error Reporting**: Optional Errors and Echoes integration (when module available)
- üß™ **Memory Integration**: Optional Memory Mage integration (pre-release development module)

**Testing Status:**

- üß™ **Alpha Quality**: Core calendar features tested and functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes System**: Creation UI functional, but editing requires calendar-aware interface for metadata management
- üìä **Test Coverage**: 72 automated tests passing (10.66% code coverage - primarily calendar engine and basic widget functionality)
- üîç **Seeking Feedback**: User testing and bug reports welcome, especially for notes system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**: See [Known Issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for current limitations

## üöÄ Planned Development

## üéÆ Game System Support

### **Current Support**

All features work with any Foundry VTT game system, with built-in calendars for:

- **Universal**: Gregorian calendar for modern/sci-fi campaigns
- **D&D Settings**: Forgotten Realms (Harptos), Greyhawk, Eberron, Dark Sun
- **Pathfinder**: Golarion (Absalom Reckoning)
- **Other Systems**: Exandrian (Critical Role), Symbaroum, Warhammer, Forbidden Lands
- **Generic Fantasy**: Vale Reckoning calendar

### **Planned Support**

Future releases may include enhanced system-specific features and additional calendar formats based on community requests.

## üêõ Known Limitations

**Current Alpha Limitations:**

- Limited testing with all possible module combinations
- Calendar creation requires JSON editing (editor planned for future)
- Some advanced Simple Calendar features not yet implemented
- Error handling could be more user-friendly

**Compatibility Notes:**

- Designed for Foundry VTT v13+ (may work with v12 but not officially supported)
- Not compatible with Simple Calendar running simultaneously
- Some weather modules may need updates for full compatibility

## üìà Success Metrics

**Current Alpha Status:**

- ‚úÖ Core functionality stable and usable
- ‚úÖ Basic Simple Calendar compatibility working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test Coverage**: Limited coverage (10.66%) - calendar engine well-tested, UI and notes systems need expansion
- üîç Community feedback and bug reports
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Barrier**: Calendar import tools needed for Simple Calendar adoption

**Success Goals by Phase:**

**Phase 2 (Calendar Tools):**

- Successful Simple Calendar migration workflow
- Community calendar creation and sharing
- Reduced migration friction for existing users

**Phase 3+ (Future):**

- Positive community reception and adoption
- Active module developer ecosystem
- Self-sustaining community contributions
