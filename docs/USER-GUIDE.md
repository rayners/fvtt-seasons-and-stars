- **Long**: "Wednesday, December 25th, 2024 CE at 2:30 PM"
- **Custom**: Based on calendar configuration

### Real-World Date Initialization

For new worlds using the Gregorian calendar:

- Automatically sets to current real-world date and time
- Only applies to worlds with worldTime = 0 (new worlds)
- Only affects Gregorian calendar (not fantasy calendars)

### Game Pause Integration

_Added in v0.12.0_

Seasons & Stars can automatically sync with Foundry's game pause state to provide seamless time management during gameplay.

#### How It Works

When **"Sync with Game Pause"** is enabled in world settings:

- **Game Paused**: Time advancement automatically pauses
- **Game Unpaused**: Time advancement resumes (if it was active before the pause)
- **Smart Resume**: Only resumes if time advancement was running before the game was paused
- **GM Control**: Only GMs can trigger resume actions for security

#### Multi-Source Pause Behavior

The pause system coordinates with other pause sources for predictable behavior:

**Pause Sources:**

- **Game Pause**: Foundry's built-in pause button (spacebar)
- **Combat Pause**: Automatic pause when combat starts (if enabled)

**Pause Combinations:**

| Game Status | Combat Status | Time Advancement             |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Running     | No Combat     | ‚úÖ **Active** (if enabled)   |
| Running     | In Combat     | ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** (combat pause) |
| Paused      | No Combat     | ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** (game pause)   |
| Paused      | In Combat     | ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** (both sources) |

**Resume Logic:**

- Time advancement only resumes when **ALL** blocking conditions are cleared
- If game is unpaused but combat is still active, time remains paused
- If combat ends but game is still paused, time remains paused
- Time only resumes when both game is running AND no combat is active

#### Configuration

**To Enable Game Pause Sync:**

1. Go to **Game Settings ‚Üí Module Settings ‚Üí Seasons & Stars**
2. Find **"Sync with Game Pause"** in the **Time Advancement** section
3. Enable the setting (enabled by default)
4. Setting change takes effect immediately

**User Feedback:**

- Notification messages inform when time advancement is paused/resumed due to game pause
- Messages clearly indicate the reason for pause/resume actions
- Messages only appear for GMs to avoid player notification spam

#### Use Cases

**During Roleplay:**

- Pause the game for discussion ‚Üí time advancement automatically stops
- Resume the game ‚Üí time advancement continues seamlessly

**Combat Management:**

- Combat starts ‚Üí time paused (combat pause)
- GM pauses game mid-combat for rules discussion ‚Üí time stays paused
- GM unpauses game, combat continues ‚Üí time stays paused (combat still active)
- Combat ends, game still running ‚Üí time resumes automatically

**Session Planning:**

- Pause game during breaks ‚Üí time advancement stops automatically
- Resume after break ‚Üí time advancement continues from where it left off

### Time Advancement Button Behavior

_Improved in v0.12.0_

The time advancement play/pause button now provides clearer, more intuitive behavior regardless of game state:

#### Intelligent Button States

**Visual State Logic:**

- **Pause Button (‚è∏Ô∏è)**: Shows when time advancement is active OR when it was active before being auto-paused
- **Play Button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)**: Shows when time advancement is fully stopped by user action

**Why This Matters:**

- Button state now reflects user intent, not just internal technical state
- No more confusion about whether time advancement is "really" running
- Clear visual feedback about what will happen when you click

#### One-Click Control

**Consistent Single-Click Behavior:**

- **When game is running**: Click works immediately (play/pause as expected)
- **When game is paused**: Click works immediately (no double-clicking required)
- **After auto-pause**: Single click to manually pause prevents auto-resume

**Previous Issue (Fixed):**
In earlier versions, clicking the pause button while the game was paused required two clicks to properly stop time advancement. This has been resolved.

#### Manual Override of Auto-Pause

**User Control Priority:**

- **Auto-pause active**: Button shows pause state, allowing you to "lock in" the pause
- **Manual pause after auto-pause**: Time advancement stays paused even when auto-pause conditions clear
- **Clear user intent**: Your manual pause action overrides automatic resume behavior

**Example Workflow:**

1. Time advancement is running ‚Üí Game pauses ‚Üí Auto-pause activates
2. Button shows pause state (‚è∏Ô∏è) ‚Üí Click once ‚Üí Manual pause locked in
3. Game unpauses ‚Üí Time advancement stays paused (respects your manual choice)

#### Multi-Source Pause Coordination

**Smart State Management:**

- System tracks difference between automatic pause (game/combat) and manual pause (user action)
- UI button state reflects the effective state (what you'll get when you click)
- Manual pause always takes priority over automatic resume

**Visual Indicators:**

- **Active**: Green/active button styling when time is actively advancing
- **Auto-paused**: Pause button available to manually stop (prevents auto-resume)
- **Manually paused**: Play button available to restart time advancement
- **Blocked**: Clear feedback when advancement is blocked by external conditions

This improved system ensures the time advancement controls work predictably and intuitively, regardless of game pause state, combat status, or other external factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Calendar Not Appearing

**Solution:**

1. Check that the module is enabled
2. Verify you're using Foundry v13 or higher
3. Try refreshing the browser
4. Check browser console for errors

#### Date Changes Not Working

**Possible Causes:**

- User lacks GM permissions
- Simple Calendar is conflicting
- Time is paused in Foundry

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you have GM rights
2. Disable conflicting calendar modules
3. Check Foundry's time controls

#### Mini Widget Positioning Issues

**Solution:**

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Toggle the widget off and on in settings
3. Check for UI module conflicts
4. Use manual positioning if needed

#### SmallTime Integration Problems

**Solution:**

1. Ensure both modules are up to date
2. Check module load order (Seasons & Stars should load after SmallTime)
3. Try disabling other UI modules temporarily

### Performance Tips

- **Large Years**: Using very large year numbers may slow calculations
- **Multiple Widgets**: Only keep necessary widgets open
- **Browser Cache**: Clear cache if experiencing strange behavior

#### Bridge Integration Issues

If you're using compatibility bridges (e.g., Simple Weather with Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge):

**Notes Not Highlighting in Calendar:**

- Some external modules may create notes that don't immediately appear as highlighted dates
- **Theoretical Fix** (‚ö†Ô∏è **UNTESTED**): Run in browser console (F12):
  ```javascript
  // WARNING: This workaround is untested and may not work
  game.seasonsStars.notes.storage.rebuildIndex();
  window.SeasonsStars.CalendarGridWidget.getInstance()?.render();
  ```
- **Better Approach**: Run diagnostic script first (see Known Issues)
- **Details**: See [Known Issues](../KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for full explanation

**Simple Weather Integration:**

- Weather data may appear in journal but not show date highlighting
- Try the untested console fix above after advancing time (no guarantee it works)
- This is a known limitation during beta testing - proper fix requires bridge enhancement

### Getting Help

1. **Check Console**: F12 ‚Üí Console for error messages
2. **Module Conflicts**: Temporarily disable other modules to test
3. **Known Issues**: Review [Known Issues](../KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for documented limitations
4. **Report Issues**: Use GitHub Issues with error details and module list

## üïê Canonical Hours

_Added in v0.12.0_

Canonical hours allow calendars to display named time periods instead of exact times, perfect for fantasy settings where characters refer to time periods like "Strange's Bells" or medieval monastery hours.

### What are Canonical Hours?

Canonical hours are named time periods that replace exact time display when the current time falls within those periods. For example:

- **"Strange's Bells"** might represent 3:00 AM - 6:00 AM
- **"Dawn's Call"** might represent 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **"Matins"** (monastery hour) might represent 2:00 AM - 3:00 AM

### How They Work

When time display is enabled, Seasons & Stars will:

1. **Check for canonical hours**: If the current time falls within a defined canonical hour period, display the canonical hour name
2. **Fall back to exact time**: If no canonical hour matches, display the exact time (e.g., "07:30")
3. **Respect display modes**: Honor the **Canonical Hours Display Mode** setting

### Display Modes

**Auto (Default)**: Shows canonical hour names when available, exact time otherwise

- 4:30 AM ‚Üí "Strange's Bells" (if 3-6 AM is defined)
- 7:30 AM ‚Üí "07:30" (if no canonical hour defined)

**Canonical Only**: Shows only canonical hour names, hides time when no match

- 4:30 AM ‚Üí "Strange's Bells"
- 7:30 AM ‚Üí (time hidden completely)

**Exact Time**: Always shows exact time, ignoring canonical hours

- 4:30 AM ‚Üí "04:30"
- 7:30 AM ‚Üí "07:30"

### Midnight Wraparound

Canonical hours can span midnight for periods like night watches:

- **"Night Watch"**: 23:00 (11 PM) - 02:00 (2 AM)

### Calendar Examples

See the **Gregorian Canonical Hours** calendar variant for examples including:

- Medieval monastery hours (Matins, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline)
- Custom fantasy hours (Strange's Bells, Dawn's Call, etc.)

### Creating Custom Canonical Hours

Calendar creators can add canonical hours to any calendar by including them in the calendar JSON:

```json
{
  "canonicalHours": [
    {
      "name": "Strange's Bells",
      "startHour": 3,
      "endHour": 6,
      "description": "The mysterious bells that ring in the early morning"
    }
  ]
}
```

See the [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) for complete technical details.

## üéØ Best Practices

### For GMs

1. **Set Expectations**: Tell players which calendar system you're using
2. **Document Important Dates**: Use notes system (when available) for events
3. **Regular Updates**: Advance time consistently during sessions
4. **Calendar Context**: Share calendar descriptions with players

### For Players

1. **Track Time**: Pay attention to date changes during gameplay
2. **Plan Ahead**: Use calendar for scheduling character activities
