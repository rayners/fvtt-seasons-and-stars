## Notes

### TypeScript Migration Strategy

When enabling `noImplicitAny`, proceed incrementally:

1. Enable flag and note all compilation errors
2. Fix public APIs first (highest impact)
3. Work through core business logic
4. Address UI components last (often most complex types)
5. Use `unknown` instead of `any` where type is truly dynamic
6. Document legitimate uses of `any` with comments explaining why

### Dependency Update Strategy

For major version updates:

1. Review changelog for breaking changes
2. Check TypeScript compatibility
3. Run full test suite
4. Test development builds
5. Update documentation if APIs change
6. Deploy to test environment before releasing

### API Change Coordination

When changing Seasons & Stars API:

1. Identify affected interfaces (hooks, TypeScript exports, public methods)
2. File tracking issue in Simple Calendar Compatibility Bridge repo
3. Provide migration examples and timeline
4. Update integration documentation
5. Add to changelog with "BREAKING CHANGE" marker if applicable

## Conclusion

The fvtt-seasons-and-stars repository has a solid foundation with excellent testing and documentation. Focus on:

1. **Type Safety** (Critical/High): Strengthen TypeScript to catch more bugs at compile time
2. **Dependency Health** (Critical/High): Keep dependencies current for security and compatibility
3. **API Management** (High): Automate coordination with dependent modules

Completing critical and high-priority items will significantly improve long-term maintainability while preserving the already-strong quality standards.
