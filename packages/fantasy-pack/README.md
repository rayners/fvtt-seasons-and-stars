## ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development

These calendar definitions are curated with help from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) to speed up data entry, formatting, and validation while I focus on accuracy and integration details. Every calendar is reviewed manually before release. Curious about the full workflow?
